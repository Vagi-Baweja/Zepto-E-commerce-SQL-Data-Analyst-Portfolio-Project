# Zepto-E-commerce-SQL-Data-Analyst-Portfolio-Project
This is a complete, real-world data analyst portfolio project based on an e-commerce inventory dataset scraped from Zepto — one of India’s fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. This project simulates real analyst workflows, from raw data exploration to business-focused data analysis.

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and was originally scraped from Zepto’s official product listings. It mimics what you’d typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.

Each row represents a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) for a product. Duplicate product names exist because the same product may appear multiple times in different package sizes, weights, discounts, or categories to improve visibility – exactly how real catalog data looks.

🧾 Columns:

sku_id: Unique identifier for each product entry (Synthetic Primary Key)

name: Product name as it appears on the app

category: Product category like Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.

mrp: Maximum Retail Price (originally in paise, converted to ₹)

discountPercent: Discount applied on MRP

discountedSellingPrice: Final price after discount (also converted to ₹)

availableQuantity: Units available in inventory

weightInGms: Product weight in grams

outOfStock: Boolean flag indicating stock availability

quantity: Number of units per package (mixed with grams for loose produce)
